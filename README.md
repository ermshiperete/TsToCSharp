# TsToCSharp

Emit C# strongly typed interface code from TypeScript definition files.

This project is intended to read in TypeScript (.d.ts) defintions files and generate as closely as possible a C# strongly typed API.

## Current Work

This is a work in progress, and we are only getting started.


## Getting Started

1. [Installing]()
2. [Usage]()
3. [TypeScript to C# mapping]()
4. [Examples]()

## Obtaining Definition files

Definitions files describe the shape of JavaScript to the TypeScript compiler and are used only to compile.

The [Definitely Typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) github repository contains a large collection of TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts).
